				<h3>The Beatles</h3>
				<h4>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</h4>
				<p>In a decade defined by sweeping cultural paradigm shifts, The Beatles’ music helped the world’s youths make sense of the changing times around them. The Fab Four’s golden years took place from approximately 1965-1969, during which they
					transformed themselves and continually progressed on the grandest of scales. As John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr went from delightful hand-holding mop-tops to psychedelic luminaries, they offered a way for the
					world to understand the complex and radical changing of the guard. While it could be said that The Rolling Stones were the purest rockers, The Beach Boys were the more innovative group or that Dylan was the lyrical visionary of his era, no
					other band had defined their generation like The Beatles. </p>

				<h3>Pink Floyd</h3>
				<h4>The Wall</h4>
				<p>The legacy of Pink Floyd was not cemented with just The Dark Side of the Moon. The Wall is one of the greatest concept albums of all time. It tells the tale of Pink, a troubled young man raised by an overprotective mother, who is trying to
					break down the wall in his mind that has been constructed by the authoritative figures in his life. It’s a painful story that most can relate to or at least comprehend, not only because so many have suffered similar pains in life, but
					because it comes from the story of a real person. Lead singer, bassist and founding member of the band Roger Waters wrote the album based on experiences in his own life. The themes that present themselves throughout the album stitch the
					story together, making a cohesive 26-track album.</p>

				<h3>Michael Jackson</h3>
				<h4>Bad</h4>
				<p>It’s bizarre to consider that the only album with five consecutive number one singles, which would go on to reach Diamond Album status in the U.S. with 10 million copies sold could ever have been a commercial disappointment. But that’s how
					high the expectations were when Michael Jackson finally followed up Thriller after five years. Planned duets with Prince, Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston and Barbra Streisand didn’t come to fruition, and the end product was a deeply
					personal album, with Jackson writing nine of the 11 tracks. Marred by the creepy (and blatantly misogynistic) track “Dirty Diana” and its sometimes overly smooth production, the album didn’t quite reach the stratospheric highs of its
					predecessors Off the Wall and Thriller.</p>

				<h3>Celine Dion</h3>
				<h4>Let’s Talk About Love </h4>
				<p>There’s nothing small or subtle about Let’s Talk About Love, from Celine Dion’s vocals to the ambitiousness of her collaborations. Barbra Streisand, Luciano Pavarotti, the Bee Gees and Diane King perform on various tracks. Carole King,
					Corey Hart and Bryan Adams wrote songs for the album. And no fewer than six Grammy-winning producers were involved, including the legendary George Martin. The album included the love-theme from Titanic, whose soundtrack barely missed making
					this list with just 100,000 fewer copies sold than Sgt. Pepper’s. Love her or hate her, Let’s Talk About Love made Celine Dion a global phenomenon. </p>

				<h3>Madonna</h3>
				<h4>The Immaculate Collection</h4>
				<p>It wasn’t enough to pack Madonna’s cleverly titled greatest hits collection with new remixes of some of the best pop songs of the 1980s (“Material Girl,” “Crazy for You,” “Like a Virgin,” “Open Your Heart,” “Lucky Star,” “Holiday,” “Into
					the Groove” and eight other hit singles), Madonna also tacked on two new originals, both of which would crack the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. The trip-hop “Justify My Love” with its controversial video would even become the
					singer/songwriter’s ninth Number One hit. This was the collection that fans had been waiting for, cementing her title as the best-selling female recording artist of all time.</p>
